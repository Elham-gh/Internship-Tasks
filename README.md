# Bonus Task 1
I solved this question using adjacency matrix. Pleae run the command ```python bonus_task/bonus1.py``` to output the order below:

['f', 'b', 'a', 'd', 'c', 'e']

# Task 2
I just added these few lines to show the algorithm I can think of in python to form a CircularArray, I could not think of an efficient algorithm for this, it is O(n). I have hard-coded a 4-element list as an example. Please run ```python task2/task2.py``` and input the start index to print array.
